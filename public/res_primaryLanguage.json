In the Navy, when sailors accidentally lock their keys inside their bunks, they'd have to call the Master At Arms to cut their locks and they'd have to buy a new set of locks and keys. But I'd tell them to hold on and let me try to pick their locks before calling the Master At Arms. Many times I'd get lucky unlocking their locks. ‚≠ê I like being original, and when people are undeniably happy with what I have for them, I'd ask 'Who's your idol?' üíú",
